### Additional Setup

Before running this project, follow these additional steps:

1. **Install Angular Material**: Angular Material provides pre-designed UI components for Angular applications. Install it by running `ng add @angular/material` and follow the instructions.

2. **Setup JSON Server**: JSON Server is a tool for creating mock REST APIs. Install it globally using npm: `npm install -g json-server`. Then, start the server and watch changes to `db.json` by running `json-server --watch db.json`.

By following these steps, you'll have Angular Material installed and JSON Server set up to provide mock API endpoints for your Angular application.
